            I don't like how much power Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc. have. The recent
            banning of Trump brought this directly into the public conscience recently.
            When it comes to the specific situation of banning Trump, I do agree that the
            right choice was made, and that Trumpist allusions to 1984 are somewhat laughable.

            However, it shows how much power these companies have. <b>
                If Google wanted to systematically
                influence or bias the public's perceptions of what is happening in the world today,
                they could do so
            </b>. The same goes for Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and other megacorps.
            These companies, which were once simply a search engine, simply a social network where
            you live-tweet your day, simply a computer company, have evolved beyond that. They
            play a much larger role in society.

            <b>The framework for these actions already exists</b> (see Cambridge Analytica). Other sayings
            such as "if the service is free, you are the product" ring true now more than ever before.
            If these companies wanted to sell their services of influencing truth, they could do it.
            Maybe to the highest bidder, maybe to policitians who are favorable to them, maybe simply
            to make more money (which is already happening). This has been happening, and it will
            continue happening. But hey, at least we have our steady dopamine drip of swipe after swipe.

            <b>I don't know what I would have done about this</b>. Certainly not allowing federal regulation
            as this would not actually decentralize power, just shift it. There is even an argument to
            be made that it would further conglomerate power. It's nice to wax poetic about how "if they
            would just do what's in the best interest of humanity...", but this isn't practical since
            it kicks off a fervent debate based on fundamental differences in personal philosophies which
            will ultimately get nowhere.
