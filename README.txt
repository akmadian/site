This is my personal website. It is built simply and transparently. No minification, no 5GB node_modules.
I would encourage you to build your sites in the same way if possible.

I used small or relatively small companies for domain registration and hosting (epik and vultr, respectively).
I would encourage you to use small companies too, if possible.

I took heavy inspiration from [@muan's personal site](https://muan.co), [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz)
was also instrumental in helping me learn about how to set up some of the basic server side stuff.
